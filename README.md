# Website Clicker Website
This is a fun side project. Allows user to click on button on website which will add there click to the server side record. 

For this project I have used Javascript and PHP. 
I hope to eventually implement AJAX Support to allow the dynamic displaying of the current count with out the need for page reloads.

Eventually I would like to add some extra functionallity to only allow a user to click on the button once in a row and require someone else on the website to click on it before they can click again.

#Key Features
Keeps a tally when user clicks on the button and displays the result.
Allows mulitple users to click at the same time.

#Issues
Currently I have not implemented dynamic loading using AJAX
